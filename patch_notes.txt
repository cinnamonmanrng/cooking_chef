- Changed: random lootboxes chances for an item lootbox now change based on player level, a player below level 2 has a 50% chance to recieve an item lootbox, from level 2 to level 4 the chance increases to 65%, level 4 to 6 chance is 75%, level 6 to 8 chance is 80% and above level 8 chance is 99%

Build 3.1 / MacOS: (Files on Mac)

- Changed: player's status will now be printed through the main function opposed to using the level up function, this avoids double printing it after finishing a recipe
