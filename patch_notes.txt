Build 26 / Windows:
- Fixed: Player could get a special recipe if they had 0 items in their inventory, the code only checked for 1 or more items when it would decide whether to grant a special recipe or not.
- Fixed: Special recipe ingredients were used when player used an incorrect item on the special recipe.
- Fixed: Some of the new items could be used on any recipes when they were meant for specific recipes.
- Fixed: An issue where a player could crash the game when putting in an invalid value in the sell recipes menu.
- Fixed: Issue where the selling a recipe function would only sell the last printed recipe instead of the player's selection
- Changed: Special Recipes are enabled
- Changed: Selling a recipe now keeps you in the Sell Recipes menu instead of bringing you back to the main menu.
- Changed: Slight text adjustment for options menu.
- Changed: Application now coded and runs in Python version 12.
- Changed: Windows 8 is no longer supported as the minimum requirement, although the game can be probably be started on windows 8 or below, future updates will not consider any system behaviours for windows 8 or below.


Build 25.1 / Windows:

- Fixed: Issue where chefgame.log would give a permission error whenever the logging function would try to write to that file. The exception was previously unhandled so that's why the error popped up.
- Fixed: Visual colour bug when opening options menu

Build 25 / Windows:

- Added: There is now an installer that installs the game and python dependencies needed by the game for the user.
- Fixed: Issue where you could cause an IndexError by picking a number out of the range of options when choosing what LootBox to open.
- Fixed: Issue where in some cases after the player gains a rating higher than 0 the game would set the random item box list to be empty so it cannot be accessed by random lootbox and would crash the game.
- Fixed: A small bug where if the player got to ratings 1 - 3 - 5 - 7 - 9, the game would give you the same lootboxes over and over again until the next rating.
- Changed: Special Recipes are temporarily removed due to 3 different issues with one special recipe, will be added back when I can figure out a fix for it.
- Current issues known and fixed in next update: 
1. Special recipes get given to players even when the player has no more recipes to cook, the best thing you can do to counteract this is to sell that recipe and claim the inventory empty lootbox from the main menu (you will see it once your inventory is empty of lootboxes)
2. Special recipes have their ingredients count reduced regardless of whether it gets cooked or not, so when you use an item that cannot be used on a special recipe, you will also lose the ingredients used for that recipe, this can be annoying but the easiest way to counteract this is to make sure you don't use items that can only be used on specific recipes on the currently available special recipe (spaghetti and meatballs in tomato sauce)
3. Also a weird small bug with special recipes where if you gain a special recipe it for some reason doesn't let you open lootboxes until you sell that special recipe. working on a fix for next build.

Build 24.1 / Windows:

- Changed: Save files will now be generated and stored in "Saves" folder inside the main game folder, creates less clutter overall.
- Changed: Cleared some unused files in the game folder
- Fixed: Visual bug when trying to delete a save file from an empty slot where the notification colour of the message "Save file slot (2 or 3) is empty" would fill every bit of text with the same colour.
- Added: Logging system that stores log files in "Logs" folder, creates log entries of specific events and errors that are used for reference in case there is a bug needing a fix.
- Added: More recipes, items and lootboxes for qualities 0 to 2

Build 24 / Windows:

- Changed: player's status will now be printed through the main function opposed to using the level up function, this avoids double printing it after finishing a recipe

- Changed: Older recipes, items and lootboxes have now been replaced by new ones

- Changed: random lootboxes chances for an item lootbox now change based on player level, a player below level 2 has a 50% chance to recieve an item lootbox, from level 2 to level 4 the chance increases to 65%, level 4 to 6 chance is 75%, level 6 to 8 chance is 80% and above level 8 chance is 99%
- Changed: Levels 1 - 4 now have different xp requirements, level 1 starts at 2000 xp, level 2 at 4500, level 3 at 7000 and level 4 at 12500
- Added: New recipes, items and lootboxes with a wider variety of recipes and items from different lootboxes
- Added: Recipes that require one or more other recipes to be cooked beforehand, these recipes will also reward the player with more experience but they will also take more time
- Added: Option to claim a LootBoxâ„¢ in the game menu ("main" function) when the player has no more recipes and no lootboxes to open
- Fixed: Issue where selling a recipe would give you a decimal number from the xp amount
- Fixed: Player will no longer be given a special recipe when they have no other recipes in their inventory
- Special Recipe: Even though you can select an item before cooking a special recipe, it will not use the item if you do not have the correct ingredients cooked to cook that recipe

Build 3.1 / MacOS: (Files on Mac)

- Note: During the first print statements of the tutorial, the keyboard module raises an OSError, but this can be ignored as it seems to work fine afterwards (running the game in sudo (administrator) will cause a segmentation fault and the game will not work)
- Fixed: the user can no longer create new lines by pressing keys while progress bar is running, although key presses will still be read and will show up after the progress bar is done
- Changed: player's status will now be printed through the main function opposed to using the level up function, this avoids double printing it after finishing a recipe
